The goal of this website/app was to create a functional workday scheduler. It gives you blocks for each hour between 9:00 AM and 5:00 PM and for each block you can type in events and save the data so that it will remain if you leave the page and return using local storage. The schedule will also color-code the hour blocks by hours that have already occurred, the hour that is present, and upcoming hours/events. In order to figure out how to color-code the hours, we've used moment.JS which will give us up-to-date time and date.
